# 1. INTRODUCTION
## 1.1 BICOM SYSTEM
BiCom System is designed to remotely know the statues of your automobiles, BiCom System operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency. In this system both the fob and Body control unit can communicate with each other.
## 1.2 DEFINING OUR SYSTEM
The System consist of a transmitter and a receiver. The receiver consist of key fob and the receier consist of Body Control Unit. Keyless remotes contain a short-range radio transmitter.
